Don't forget to push the new red_pitaya_top.bit to the Red Pitaya. Otherwise, Python will try to read at non-existing address and will crash.

If you reconnect to an running box that have never run, most of the value will be zero and the GUI might not be usable.
To correct the situation, you need to go to the settings tab and open the communication menu. Then, you will be able to push the default values to the Red Pitaya
TO DO: look at a value (or create a boolean) to see if the box have already run. If not, push the default values.

For now, Python doesn't read the current state from the VNA, so if the VNA-dither is active when you reconnect, you won't know
